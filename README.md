# NBody Simulation in rust

This is a (currently) simple NBody simulation written in rust.

## Usage

You can run the simulation with `cargo run --release -- coordinatesfile.csv`.

This repository contains some sample coordinates files in `examples/`, if you want to generate your own custom coordinates, you can use the `generate_coordinates.py` script.

## Why?

This is a project I started to learn rust. I'll try to gradually go from a simple simulation to a more complex one (single threaded, threaded, openMPI).
